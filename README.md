# FOR-FUN is a file contains a collection of Python code snippets written by me that are intended for entertainment and educational purposes only. These codes range in complexity and difficulty, with some being quite simple and suitable for those new to programming, while others may be more advanced and challenging for more experienced programmers. It is important to note that the contents of this file are purely for fun and should not be taken too seriously. They are not meant to be used in any practical or professional context, but rather as a means of learning and exploring the capabilities of the Python programming language in a casual and enjoyable way.
